I had time for painting… then I didn’t. Now I am back to my old seat in Harmony Park, Steadlier in hand and a head full of dreams.

Someone said to me recently that they liked my series of people on phones… I don’t decide who to draw based on what they are doing. I just choose the closest person too me without them being close enough that they will see what I am doing. They are of course invariably on the phone but it was not my intention for this to happen. I am just busting my ass to get a drawing out before the clock strikes the end of my lunch break and I have to retreat to the bunker where our agency locks all the developers so the clients don’t accidentally bump into them when they come in for coffee and cakes with the designers.

I am doing far less than one per day… I feel it in the enjoyment I am getting from them. They are easier to enjoy when you can see progress. The bigger the velocity of your output the more evident your progress is. Anyway, I just need to keep it ticking over till someone gives me an extra 2 hours per day to go with the 24 I currently have.
