My aunty Rachel told me that I had to do them bigger. I have been doing them all A4 size under the pretence that they are just practice. But of course she is right. I may as well practice on a size that might actually look good on the wall. So I bought an A3 size pad of paper. The last 2 here are on that size.

I am painting the drawings I did earlier in the year. It is great because you arenâ€™t looking at a photo or real life, which means you arenâ€™t caught up in realism. This is a great way to loosen up. The colours are all your own. The forms are all waaaay off real lifeâ€¦ just the way it should be. One of these is a painting of a painting of a drawing. ðŸ˜±
