My friend, Christian Campano, asked me to paint him for his album cover. He came over wearing a pink hat (he loves hats). Iâ€™m not sure what the colours of his other clothes were. I am pretty sure he wasnâ€™t wearing a light green t-shirt and his sunnies were definitely not blue. Anyway, I took some photos and then spent most of the month drawing from those photos. I was really happy with a few of them but he was stuck on the fact that the ones I liked made him look african american. I told him we are all one race in the eyes of God and that I canâ€™t control the paintbrush. It has a mind of itâ€™s own. Take it or leave it. He ended up liking it after a few more conversations. The power of persuasion. A painting doesnâ€™t have to be good for someone to take it, you just have to talk it up. It does help if it is free though. ðŸ–¼

People seem to like the paintings of trees. It is strange, as these are my least favourite. By people I mean one person mentioned it.
