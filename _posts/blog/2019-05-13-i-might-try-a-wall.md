I participated in a group show organised by my cousin at the end of last month. There were a LOT more people there than the last one I had in the Multiple States studio. Having to organise and choose a group of works is a good thing. It makes you think about what you like about your work and why. It allows you to identify themes that you miss when you are just head down producing. Framing and hanging them is also a good exercise. I usually only see my paintings unframed and sitting in front of me on my desk before they make the 2 meter journey to the filing cabinet. To get them on the wall is greatly satisfying. Even if you don’t sell a thing. 😬

Aside from the show this was a pretty awful month of art. I drew a few more trees because someone made an off-hand comment about liking them. I tried a bigger canvas. It looks awful. And I tried my hand at graffiti again, which, when you haven’t been doing it for a while, always turns out terribly. I did manage to do one painting I liked of a woman with some fruit on her head. I suppose that better than nothing? 💃🍇
