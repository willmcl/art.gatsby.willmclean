Persistence is paying dividends. When I first started with the pencil I came at it from the perspective of colour only. I assumed that to differentiate between shapes I would need to use colours from white to black on the greyscale exclusively. As I have done more and more I have been pushed to come up with more varied ways to fill my shapes. This challenge has forced me to experiment with the marks the pencil makes. Scribbles, swirls and stripes are all things I was not really thinking about at the beginning. But those marks, combined with the greyscale are starting to give the drawings a bit of zing. They also make it look more toy. Important. Very important. ðŸš’
