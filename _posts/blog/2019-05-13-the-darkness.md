I canâ€™t even put them on Instagram! I hate pencil. My drawings are looking like 1st year uni illustrator holiday sketches. For a while there I was harbouring a secret hope that I might actually have a future in art â€” what a joke! My social media presence is taking a battering. I havenâ€™t posted in months! My friends and family will be wondering what is happening. I havenâ€™t had a single off-hand compliment about my posts. I need those likes. Iâ€™m a confidence player and Iâ€™m low on gasâ€¦. Ergghhhhhh. ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜© This is dark man. How can I carry on?
