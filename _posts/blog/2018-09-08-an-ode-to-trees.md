Oh trees, you have so many branches, but I canâ€™t draw them all so I cut most of them off.
Oh trees, sometimes your trunk is darker than your leaves, sometimes the other way around,
How am I meant to keep up?
Oh trees, it is overwelming trying to draw you, this is because you have hundreds of thousands of leaves.
Oh trees, Am I meant to draw every leaf? Or just draw a bulky circle round each clump of your leaves and use my pencil to mirror the texture of many leaves together?
Please tell me, oh trees.

Stay tuned next month for an ode to people sitting down for lunch.
