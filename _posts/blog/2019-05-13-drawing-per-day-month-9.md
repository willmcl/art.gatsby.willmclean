Here is the trick. Forget the output and focus on the process. Donâ€™t go in with an idea of what the painting is going to look like and you will never be disappointed. This is a great way to maintain motivation and confidence. Especially when you are just starting out like me and you have no control whatsoever over the brush or the paint or the crap you will produce.

I have dropped the drawings and now I am doing a painting per day. It is great fun. I bought a book called Colour: A workshop for artists and designers by David Hornung. It was a real eye opener. I realised that there are a whole range of colours available under 80% saturation!!! What-da-ya-know!!! ðŸ˜±
