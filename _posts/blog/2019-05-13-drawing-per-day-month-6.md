Naivety is a hard thing to come by and then an even harder thing to keep hold of. Losing all the stiff, formal rules of drawing that have been taught to you over the years is the first step. And that is not too hard when you didn’t listen particularly hard when you were taught those rules and then weren’t that good at them anyway. So it is possible to shake those off and produce a few decent naive 👶🏻 drawings. But then once you start drawing more and more you become more and more proficient and the drawings start to look more and more skilled. Your natural drawing movements become better and better. It is an awful catch 22. The more you want to draw like a child the harder it becomes.

Sometimes they just turn out well. It is a mixture, I think, of subject, composition and the stars aligning with your drawing. The lines just happening to fall in the right place completely by chance.
