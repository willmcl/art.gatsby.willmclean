I have found a group photo and am painting every face from it. It is the perfect photo because the faces are far enough away that I can’t get hung up on the details. I have to just make a few things up. This appeals to my speed over substance methodology. I am liking the results and I put a few on Instagram and I got a bunch of likes. The likes were mainly from my Aunty Rachel, who is insanely positive about anything her nephews and nieces do, but they are still pretty encouraging.  Never underestimate the motivating power of a few likes from family and friends. 💖

Faces are pretty good fun but they have a downside. The first thing anyone asks is “Who is it?”. Unless you choose to tell a bald face lie and say “Oh someone you don’t know” you have to tell them. And then, unless you are bloody Raphael their comment is always “Oh.. right… Yeah… I don’t really see it.”

“Well, for GOD’S SAKE!! — I’m not a f-ing camera.”
