I have run out of things to draw. I have drawn every photograph in my house. I have switched to photos in books and a box of James Bond, 007 postcards that I was given for Xmas one year. ðŸ”«â›·

I have had to start making things up, which is a whole new ball game. Takes a bit more energy than I really want to expend. Ughhhh.

I am getting nice and scratchy though. I like that. The dryer brush is working a lot better for me. It feels like I am managing to wrestle my way out of always doing solid lines. That is a graffiti, comic and illustration thing. I am an artist now. ðŸ¦„
