The major benefit of doing one drawing per day is that it forces you to not care. The one per day is more important than the drawing — “Just get it done so you can go to bed for god’s sake”

At the end of the month you look back and think “Oh, I actually made progress. Well that really is a surprise.”

If I can do 365 of these things then there is bound to be one or two that are half decent… Maybe i’ll have an exhibition… but who the hell would I invite? It’d probably just be Flora and her mum. I can just show them in person when I get home. OK, forget the exhibition.

I think in these I am managing to get  a little bit more naive. I like the faces when they are just two blobs for eyes and a smiling mouth. I like the background on this one just being essentially a few squiggles with the brush. It is better than trying to paint it realistically. However it is hard to remember to do that when you are drawing from a photo or life. Your inclination is to draw what you see as best you can. I’ve got to remember to forget that. 😬
