A good entry into painting for anyone who wants to have a crack seems to be shapes. People and scenes are where it gets a little hairy. Shapes allow you to just focus on two things: how you get the paint on the paper and colour. Getting the paint on the paper is a tricky thing. I have to say, I took it for granted when looking at art. It always seems pretty straightforward. Get the paintbrush, stick it in some paint and paint it on the paper. But learning how to deal with a brush fully loaded with paint, or one completely empty, or one with dark in itâ€™s bristles but light over the top or the other way round is much harder than I thought.

After I finish a painting I then paint out all the leftover paint. This process is as good a practice of how to use the brush as the actual painting. The bonus is that you get quite a lot of squares of coloured paper (Colours you would never normally have thought to create) that are quite good for making collages. You can use the collages as cards for your loved ones, therefore saving you loads of cash.
