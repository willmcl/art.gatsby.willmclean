Oh thank god!!! Finished another year. The relief is immense. It is like finishing school again. What am I going to do with all my spare time? I sure as hell won’t be filling it with painting! I’ll be happy if I never do another painting in all my life. I’m going to chuck out my paints right now.

I had an exhibition at the Multiple States studio with Kevin. We invited all our friends and family. We went to Sainsbury’s and bought a bunch of beers and wine and put them on a table in the middle of the studio. We got rid of all our desks and we put them in the games developers’ studio next door. I bought 32 Tesco’s A4 frames for the work and hung them in two long straight lines of 16. People told me they really liked the work, but they are all friends, so what else are they going to say. No art dealer came in and offered me a 10 year deal or a big commission. Maybe I just didn’t use social media enough in the lead up.
