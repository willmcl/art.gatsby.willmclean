I have a new job and unlike Multiple States, they don’t allow a full day of free play, personal development every Friday 🙄. Not surprising really, they are trying to make money. I’m a suit and this certainly spells the end of my painting. If I don’t do it on a Friday then it won’t get done. Trying to carve out some spare time outside working hours between my commitments as a father, husband and a 5th grade footy player is too hard. No more painting for a little while, however my new employer still offers me a full hour lunch break every day so I have decided to work then. However, a change in medium is probably necessary. I can’t set up in the park with full set of paints and an easel – I’ll get paint on my suit 👔. So I have gone with an A5 pad of paper and a 8B Staedtler Mars® Lumograph® pencil. It is blacker than black. ⬛️

I have found it very difficult to be happy with the results. They are all coming out a bit 1st year uni. But in some of them I am catching glimpses of something that may turn out to be half decent so I will persevere. A change is as good as a holiday, that’s what I always say.
