Sometimes you just produce crap. You have to get used to it if you are going to keep going. It is a form slump. Sportspeople go through them all the time. When you are on, you are on. Things just come off. When you are off you are well and truely off. Go back to the simple things. Stop painting faces and start painting simple shapes. Set yourself some rigid tasks. Use limited colours. Go back to basics. Soon you will be back out there kicking goals, throwing fend offs and drilling opposition players into the turf…

…I’ve been watching too much footy.

These are now taking much more time then I first intended. God damn I am looking forward to the end of the month.
