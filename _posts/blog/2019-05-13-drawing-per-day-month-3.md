I think I have now drawn almost every photograph in my house. One drawing a day is quite a lot. Subsequently, it forces you to focus on speed. You canâ€™t possibly set aside 2 hours per day for your drawing. They need to be done in 5 minutes. And they are.

The speed makes you recognise that this is just practice. Like any skill drawing requires practice. Doing one per day has made me realise I was never actually working towards being an artist or illustrator before now. Even when I was actually doing quite a lot of illustration jobs.Too long have I sat around saying I am an illustrator and producing a hand full of sketches per year. It is now plainly obvious that to get anywhere I will need to do much more than one per day. I will need to quit my highly lucrative (ðŸ™„) developer job and draw all day every day. How did I not see that before?

Right! Gotta get back to it.
