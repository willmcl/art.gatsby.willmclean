I feel like I am trying to forget every stylistic rule I have ever learned since starting university. As a young man I grabbed hard to whatever style school was on trend and stole like billy-o. For me, the majority of these styles were focused on clean lines. When I started uni vector drawings were just hitting the big time — all clean lines and no texture. Nowadays I can’t stand most of the work I aspired to in that period and appreciate a whole range of styles for many different reasons. However, I am still trying to unlearn the things I stole from that style school for myself. I am trying to unlearn clean lines, unlearn consistency, unlearn refinement and unlearn lines being in the spot you think they should be. 🖌👶🏻

Well isn’t painting the hardest thing going around! I thought I could do this no problem. And whilst I often say I am going for the toy style I have to be honest on this one and say I was going for far less toy style than it turned out. But hey ho. Gotta start somewhere! ✍🏽🐣
