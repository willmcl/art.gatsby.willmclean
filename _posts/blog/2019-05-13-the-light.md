If last month was the darkness this month is the light. I feel a lot better about them. I always pride myself on being pragmatic and not wallowing around in a dirty bath filled with self pity, but sometimes I find myself in that bath. Becoming disheartened with your work can sneak up on you out of nowhere. It can be triggered by something to do with the work, like doing a bad drawing, or by something completely unrelated, like GWS losing a preliminary final for the second year in a row. 😫

This month things started working again. I stood up, stepped out of that bath, dried myself off, put some clothes on and did a post on Instagram. I started to enjoy the work and it started to show in the product. Happy equals free and loose lines. Wallowing in self pity equals tight and nasty. Gotta stay loose. The pencil thing is really starting to work. I love some of the people I drew this month. I am finding that naivety I am always after. They aren’t looking as forced as they have been in the previous months. ONWARDS! 🏌🏋🏊
