Where am I? Who am I? My arms canâ€™t move. A thousand pins poked into my eyes. I smell sour. Is it me? No. Iâ€™m covered in something. Vomit. Is it mine? I donâ€™t recall drinking a pint of milk. But I donâ€™t recall anything? My mind is fluffy. Iâ€™m in a thick white cloud. Or is it soup? Heavy soup. Did I drink that milk?â€¦ Maybe. Breastmilk. That rings a bell. I do remember that. What time is it? Iâ€™m pulling myself up to standing. Breastmilk. Iâ€™m walking over to the desk. Wipes. I canâ€™t think. Crying. I just know just one thing. Tiredness. No! I know one more thingâ€¦

My eyes are bleeding. I rub away the blood. I must focus. I have a show. I must draw. I pick up my pencilâ€¦
