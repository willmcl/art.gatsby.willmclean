After a year of producing a comic per day I am tired. It was becoming a burden. The strict format I had developed left little room for my grand creative desires. 🙄 “Thank god that is over.” I utter upon finishing the final comic. Hopefully it was worth the pain.

This year I will be far less strict in the format. I will produce one drawing per day. Any size, any content, any media. I began the year using ink on any scrap of paper I could find. I want to lose the comic style. I want to be a grown up. I want to produce grown-up drawings.

I am pleased with the discovery of combining a scratchy ink pen with a paintbrush. Using a ruler with the ink pen seems to be working.

This and the following few are just a bit too true-to-life for my liking. I need to loosen up. I need to make more mistakes. I need to get more toy.
