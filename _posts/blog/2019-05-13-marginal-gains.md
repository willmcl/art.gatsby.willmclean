In a bid to make myself look more like a real-life artist I have decided to put sizes in the captions to my work. This will gain me some street cred (…in the gallery) as it makes it look like I know what I am doing. It helps that this month I did a few that weren’t 15cm x 21cm. I look a bit more varied. In fact, this month I really did branch out, I did 4 A3 drawings on my way to a whopping 56cm x 76cm one! Which took me fo0000r-EVER! I had to get a special piece of masonite from bunnings so I didn’t pick up the grain on the table when doing bulk shading.

I am also going to write what materials I used. This also will help me look like a serious artist. I will use art words like graphite instead of pencil and gouache instead of paint and cartridge instead of paper. It is all about keeping up appearances. Marginal gains. Everything counts in the pursuit of a sale.
