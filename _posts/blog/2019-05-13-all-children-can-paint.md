If you ever want to learn how to paint properly sit down with your two year old for a session with the poster paints and an A3 pad of paper. If you don’t have a two year old then borrow one. If you don’t know anyone with a two year old then get in touch. You can borrow mine for as long as you want.

Anyway, they paint with such reckless abandon it is breathtaking to watch. The content they choose to paint is ridiculously insightful. Family, events and people from random encounters in weeks gone by. They never miss or let you miss the important things, like the scar on your forehead in a family portrait. They know exactly when a drawing is finished and they are always happy with it. There is a LOT you can learn from a collaboration with a two year old.

I am pretty sure I heard someone smart say that all children can paint, they just lose it as people start to teach them and they grow self awareness. It was along those lines anyway. Probably phrased in a slightly more catchy way.
