I have finally found a bit of time and some space in my house to start painting again. I am really enjoying it. The best thing is I am using canvas boards so they feel like real paintings when they are completed. They are also easier to move around than paper. I can sit in front of the GWS game or Frozen and still paint. The boards balance really nicely on your knees. It is also great to have a bit of company. It can be a bit lonely and anti-social hiding away upstairs straight after dinner. I actually get more done because when I am alone upstairs I get a real fear of missing out and after about two brush strokes I saunter on downstairs looking for a cup of tea and a chat. If I am painting downstairs in front of the telly with everyone buzzing around I can paint for ages.

It is always hard getting back into a medium you have not been practising for a while. I am not expecting much for a little while yet. Anyway, they are fun to do regardless of how they turn out.
