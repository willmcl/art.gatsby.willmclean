I have moved home to Sydney and bought a new set of paints. I have been buying a set of paint colours that was specified in the book I mentioned once before ( [Colour: A workshop for artists and designers](https://www.laurenceking.com/us/product/color-2nd-edition/) by [David Hornung](http://davidhornung.com/)) and mix my own colours from that set. The set is:

* \    Cool red – Often named crimson or carmine
* \    Warm red – Often named flame red, vermilion red or permanent or cadmium scarlet
* \    Cool yellow – Lemon yellow, canary, permanent yellow or yellow light
* \    Warm yellow – Permanent yellow deep or Indian yellow
* \    Cool blue – Ultramarine blue
* \    Warm blue – Ultramarine green shade, turquoise blue, cerulean hue, sky blue or pthalo blue
* \    Red earth tone – Red ochre or burnt sienna
* \    Yellow earth tone – Yellow ochre or yellow oxide
* \    Blue earth tone – Indigo, ash blue, payne’s grey or greyish blue
* \    White – Permanent white, NOT zinc white
* \    Dark brown – Sepia or burnt umber

In the UK I was using a cheapish Windsor and Newton series but this was unavailable so I bought Jo Sonja. The art shop on King St in Newtown didn’t have all my specific colours available either. The change in brand and the slight variation in base colours has produced a lot less saturated colours than my previous paintings. I missed my old paints initially but now prefer the colours created with these.

It is interesting that a change in circumstance can lead to such a large change in the work. I like that. I will now always be able to recognise paintings before and after that move across the world. I wonder how many other artists work has been altered by that sort of thing. Picasso’s widely acclaimed blue period was not a conscious decision by a brilliant artist or a reflection of his state of mind after his friend’s death — there was only blue paint left at Bunnings.
