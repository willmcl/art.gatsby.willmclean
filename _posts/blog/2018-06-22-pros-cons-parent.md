Cons

    It is tiring
    You have to get a job
    You have to give up everything  you ever loved doing
    They take every opportunity to test your patience
    Your house smells like vomit
    You have no money
    Once they learn to talk they never stop
    They are better at painting than you

Pros

    You get to spend blissful afternoons collaborating with your beloved daughter on paintings of her favourite soft toys and other make believe creatures that extend your concept of a successful painting experience and exercise your imagination.
