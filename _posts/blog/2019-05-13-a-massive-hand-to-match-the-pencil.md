I was asked to be in Works On Paper 2017 at China Heights. This is awesome! I’m in a REAL exhibition. I had to produce a 56cm x 76cm work. I decided to scale up one of my smaller drawings. Transfering the feel of the small drawing to a larger format was hard. It was a bit more effort to keep the fluidity and looseness. I began to wish I had a massive pencil to match the massive paper size… but then i’d need a massive hand to match the pencil and then a massive arm to match the hand etc. etc. However I don’t really want to be 12 foot tall. I’d be a freak. I’d be ostrascised and forced to live in a circus for ever. Trundled out for viewings every hour, on the hour. People would stare and yell “Show us your pencil you big freak!” So actually I think I would rather it just as it is – a normal pencil with a big sheet of paper.
