I am not sure I ever found drawing enjoyable. Not as far as I can remember. I found it hard work. It involved a lot of concentration. It was very emotional as I always wanted the drawings to be good and they never were… well they certainly weren’t perfect. I drew out of a mix of guilt (“Oh, I really should do some drawings. I haven’t done any in ages”), envy (“That person’s drawings are so good, I wish I was that good”) and boredom (“What should I do while I am watching this crap telly?”).

Whilst doing one drawing per day stemmed from at least two of those feelings (guilt and envy) it has actually changed the way I feel about drawing. Due to the speed I no longer agonise over a drawing. I just get it done. I am no longer emotional as I accept that a drawing might turn out crap and I don’t worry as I know I’ll get another crack tomorrow. So now I am starting to look forward to sitting down and churning a drawing out. What a breath of fresh air. I actually enjoy drawing. 😍

Cars make excellent subjects. They don’t move, they don’t look ugly or distorted when you draw them badly. I really like drawing cars. 🚗 🚕.🚙
