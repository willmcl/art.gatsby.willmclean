The process should give you the best chance of producing something half decent. This is the process:

1. \    Find an image to draw
2. \    Find an A4 piece of paper to draw it on
3. \    Draw the image before you a) have to go to work b) have to clean up the kitchen or c) fall asleep. Take no longer than 10 minutes.
4. \    a) Go to work b) clean up the kitchen or c) go to bed.
5. \    When you a) return home b) finish cleaning or c) wake up. Put the drawing in the drawer with all your other drawings and forget about it.
6. \    Repeat the following day and every day after that.
7. \    At the end of the month get out all your drawings and see if any are worth scanning in for your website.

It is amazing that a process that, on paper, looks as if it has no chance of producing anything decent is actually the most likely way for me to produce a half decent drawing. I suppose it may not work for everyone, but it does for me.
